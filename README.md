**Project Title**: Real-Time Data Logging with STM32

- **Objective**: 
  - Develop a system to collect and store data in real-time using the STM32 microcontroller.

- **Key Components**:
  - **STM32 Microcontroller**: Central processing unit for data collection and system control.
  - **Sensors**: Devices to capture various environmental or operational data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
  - **Storage Medium**: Memory components like SD card or EEPROM for data storage.
  - **Communication Interface**: Protocols like UART, I2C, or SPI to facilitate sensor integration and data transfer.
  - **Power Supply**: Stable power source for continuous operation of the system.

- **Methodology**:
  - **System Design**: Define architecture, select appropriate sensors, and determine storage requirements.
  - **Hardware Integration**: Connect sensors and storage devices to the STM32 microcontroller.
  - **Firmware Development**: Write and debug code for data acquisition, processing, and logging.
  - **Testing and Validation**: Ensure accurate data collection and reliable system performance.

- **Applications**:
  - Environmental monitoring
  - Industrial automation
  - Health monitoring systems
  - Data acquisition in research projects

- **Skills Acquired**:
  - Embedded systems programming
  - Real-time data processing
  - Hardware-software integration
  - Troubleshooting and debugging

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with real-time data logging systems, enhancing skills in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.
